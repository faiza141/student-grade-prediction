# Project Overview:

This project focuses on predicting student final grades based on various academic and personal features. I applied linear regression to model the relationship between input features and the final grade outcomes.

#Key Features:

Model: Simple Linear Regression

Performance: Achieved an RÂ² score of 77%, showing a solid predictive capability.

Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn

#Highlights:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection

Handling missing data and outliers

Model training, testing, and evaluation

Visualization of model performance and error analysis

#Objective:

The goal was to create a predictive model that helps estimate a student's performance, providing insights that could be useful for early intervention and academic support programs.
